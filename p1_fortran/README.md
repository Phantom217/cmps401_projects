## Program Goals

- Write a FORTRAN program under the Ubuntu Operating System that will handle
    weights, lengths, acceleration and temperatures equivalents:
    + Convert Pounds to Kilograms and vice versa.
    + Convert Feet to Meters and vice versa.
    + Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa.

- The program should ask the user what type of conversion he/she desires.

- Upon choosing the desired type of conversion, the program should display the
    conversion **without** terminating, allowing the user an option to terminate
    or select another type.
